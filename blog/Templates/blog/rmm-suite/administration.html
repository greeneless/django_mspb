  <h5><i>Standards and Practices</i></h5>
  <p>These Standards and Practices (SAP) documents are examples of how an organization can define their best practices. These cover the key points to address, and are often detailed in Run Books or Operation Guides. These are presented here to use as-is or to customize to become the basis for your own Standards and Practices library.</p>

  <h5><i>Documentation Aids</i></h5>
  <p>Documents that help create standard methods of documenting customer configurations, particularly things that change often.</p>
  <p><strong><a title="Network At A Glance worksheet" href="https://dist.mspbuilder.com/_media_/Documents/Manuals/Network_AtAGlance.xltx" target="_blank"><img class="" src="https://www.mspbuilder.com/Data/Sites/1/media/Icons/ExcelLogo32.png" alt="" /> Network At A Glance Worksheet</a></strong><br />A simple method of network documentation in a ready to print format (if you don't modify the columns!). We use this internally, keep it up to date, and print it quarterly for key staff to take offsite as part of D/R preparation.</p>
  <h5><i>Operational Documents & Checklists</i></h5>
  <p>These documents are used by MSP practices to ensure all steps are followed when performing common internal operational processes. All documents are unlocked to allow simple customization to your needs.</p>
  <p><strong><a title="Customer Offboarding Checklist" href="https://dist.mspbuilder.com/_media_/Documents/Manuals/Customer_Offboarding_Checklist.xltx" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.mspbuilder.com/Data/Sites/1/media/Icons/ExcelLogo32.png" alt="" /> Customer Off-boarding Checklist</a></strong><br />An Excel Template with steps for customer off-boarding/termination.</p>

  <h5><i>Customer & Location Management Table</i></h5>
  <p>
    <img height="95%" width="95%" src="https://www.mspbuilder.com/Data/Sites/1/media/Images/CustLoc.png" alt="Customer Locations Spreadsheet" />
    <br>This tool lets you create new customer organizations and/or locations by simply adding a record to an Excel spreadsheet. Define the Org ID, customer name, and a few other parameters to define what kind of devices will be maintained at each location. Run the Prep tool and the location (country, region/state, and city) will be looked up in the United Nations LOCODE database. This will be used for the default location group name. You can then edit the spreadsheet to modify or replace the location ID if desired. The Update tool is then used to read the spreadsheet and automatically update VSA with the new organizations, locations, and appropriate machine-group structure. This ensures a consistent structure with minimal effort. You can, of course, use your own location codes.
  </p>
  <p>The example above shows the mega-co locations in NYC and San Francisco, plus an Azure data center associated with the NYC location. The codes were inserted by automation from the LOCODE spreadsheet, with the datacenter adjusted to identify the Azure location using a "qualifier" column (not shown). The W/S/T/P column designated the first NYC location as the primary, and the Azure location as only having server devices. The tool will make sure that the customer and all necessary location and agent-type groups are created with minimal manual effort.</p>

  <h5><i>Server Patch Management Spreadsheet</i></h5>
  <p>
    <img height="95%" width="95%" src="https://www.mspbuilder.com/Data/Sites/1/media/Images/PatchMgmtSS.PNG" alt="Patch Management Spreadsheet" />Manage and report on server patch schedules using an Excel Spreadsheet. The&nbsp;<em>GetPatchCodes&nbsp;</em>tool collects the list of servers*, customers, and currently defined patch schedule codes from Kaseya and populates an Excel spreadsheet. This allows the administrator to assign schedule codes to each sever and immediately verify the code is correct. The spreadsheet displays the week, day, and time that the schedule code represents. Once all of the servers have been assigned schedule codes, the spreadsheet is saved, and the&nbsp;<em>SetPatchCodes</em>&nbsp;tool updates VSA with the data from the spreadsheet. Hundreds of servers can be accurately scheduled for Windows Updates in just minutes. The spreadsheet can then be used to generate reports showing which servers (and customers) will be updated at any given time. This is an ideal report to send to your on-call team each week. In the example shown here, the patch codes are defined and the corresponding schedule is displayed in the blue fields. Note the servers in the data center ("dc" prefix") are scheduled for the last cycle of patching (Week 1) and spread out to ensure that the systems reboot in a sequence that allows the application dependencies to be handled.

      <span class="font-small">*The tool collects objects from the server group, so workstations that function as servers are also listed and can be scheduled properly.

  <h5><i>Password Cipher</i></h5>
  <p>The RMM Suite heavily leverages Managed Variables to define customer-specific information. This can be used to define both customer-specific and MSP-specific accounts. Unfortunately, the Managed Variables are stored in clear-text, making them visible to anyone with VSA access. Our Cipher tool allows the VSA administrator to cipher the password and store the ciphered value in the managed variable. The ciphers are customer-specific and use a proprietary method that is fast and secure. A password of just 6 characters can result in over 281&nbsp;<em>trillion&nbsp;</em>unique cipher combinations. The ciphered value is secure while "at rest" in the Kaseya VSA and while "in flight" to the agent. The application that we developed to&nbsp;create or update&nbsp;local accounts can determine from VSA if the password is ciphered. If it is, it requests the customer-specific part of the key, then deciphers the password just prior to making the system call to create or update the local account.</p>
